I was about 17 and still living at home. Pretty nice neighborhood, with houses 
real close together. Anyway, I was at wal-mart one day and saw they had small 
garden gnomes for sale for super cheap, likes couple dollars per. So naturally 
i bought as many as I could. I had maybe 40-50 and absolutely no idea what to 
do with them. A few days later I was walking my dog, pit-bull/ boxer mix and 
the sweetest thing, and I passed a lady with a small dog. This little dog 
started barking at mine and this lady fucking kicked my dog. I didn’t know 
what to do but I saw her rush home and go inside, and that’s when I got an 
idea. Every night between 1130-0100 I would walk up to her front door and put 
one gnome just right in their entry way. I’d get up the next day for school and 
sometimes see her look at it and throw it away. As the days passed I got more 
creative and started hiding them, or putting them in little scenes. One day I 
saw her and her husband yelling at each other pointing at them. I am pretty 
sure I drove them insane and it was well worth the money I spent. Don’t kick 
my fucking dog.
